          <h2 class="fast-para">Why Learn Web Development Online</h2>
          <p class="fast-para">
            As a web developer, your credibility is more about the strength of
            your portfolio than it is about your credentials. Your employment
            opportunities will often come from concrete skills and samples of
            your work rather than a degree from a university. It’s not that a
            proper college education isn’t important or valuable as a web
            developer. Rather, it’s to say that if attending a university isn’t
            in the cards, you can learn everything you need to know about web
            development online. The web development industry continues to grow
            exponentially so you won’t find a shortage of resources. The most
            important thing to do is start.
